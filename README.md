<h3>We have created an online specliazed platform that allows college students to connect with each other and make the college expereince more enrriching. <br>The lack of sufficient access to study materials poses a challenge to collaborative learning among senior and junior students.<br>
  The platform should enable seamless sharing of textbooks, lecture notes, and other resources enhancing collaborative learning and expanding academic horizons for students.
